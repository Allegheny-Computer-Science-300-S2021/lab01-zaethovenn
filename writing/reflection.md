In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, with your response.

### First Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
The first tool I chose was genome wide association study. This study is used to look at the entire genome and see if there are any outliers that will most likely change. Change in a deadly disease is very important to know about if your trying to combat and protect others.
 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This method is used and worked by taking in real data about  virus or disease and you analyze the the make up of the disease. After analyzing the data among all those among the study and looking for differences you compare and check for potential mutants.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
this tool was a necessity for development and combat upon potential dangers that might be associated with the studied disease. This method is useful for studying the makeup of the entire society of disease to better protect ourselves from the dangers.
 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 I don't see how there could be a misuse of this studying method but if you were to incorrectly study the data anything could be possible.


### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
the next tool i chose wsa the computer aided drug design and this is used for creating the correct drug to combat the disease.
 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This method works by using computational methods to develop the right vaccine or drug to combat a specific disease.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
this tool is necessary because its used to help heal entire populations of sick or ill people from a combatant. This method is perfect for people who work in computers and bioinformatics because it intertwines the two fields to help cure people.
 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 Plenty of things could go terribly wrong if a drug was developed and side effects were very prominent you could badly injure people who are already vulnerable.
